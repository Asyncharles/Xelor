# Xelor
The Xelor project is designed to reduce the ecological impact of human habitats by optimizing energy consumptions. We aim to have a simple code open to every developer, as well as a configuration interface for all non-technical users.
The XelorClient allows extern input & output devices connection. This feature is for now only opened for developers, that can link their devices. 

# Under Heavy Development
Please note that the Xelor AI is still under heavy development, and that the project isn't finished. If you wish to compile and run the code, to look out for any bugs, you are welcome to do so!
If you wish to report a bug, you free to open an issue or to contact us via email : xelor.services@gmail.com or discord : https://discord.gg/jchrtmynqT

# Engine
The Engine used to run the AI is not finished, and is still being developed and tested.
